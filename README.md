# TrICNET
A simple Tensorflow.js webapp for transfer learning image classification

Just add the .js and .html to a web page (glitch.com works well for simple testing)

Point the camera at your first target (A) to train the model on (between 15 and 20 images of the target should suffice) repeat for remaining targets.

Voila! your browser should be recognizing objects with the accuracy of 1000 watchmakers. 

RUN THE DEMO APP
